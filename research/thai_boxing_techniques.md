# Thai Boxing (Muay Thai) Techniques and Terminology

This document provides a comprehensive overview of Muay Thai techniques, terminology, and match structure to serve as a foundation for our AI vision app development.

## Striking Techniques

### Punches (Muay Mat)

1. **Jab**: A straight punch thrown from the lead hand. Not considered a power shot, typically used to control range and create openings for other strikes.

2. **Cross**: A powerful straight punch thrown from the rear hand.

3. **Hook**: A horizontally looping punch that travels in a half-circle to target the side of an opponent's head and jaw.

4. **Uppercut**: A vertically looping punch in which the fist travels downwards before it's driven up beneath an opponent's chin.

5. **Body-Rip/Body-Hook**: A looping punch that follows an angled line, midway between a hook and uppercut to target the side of an opponent's body.

6. **Spinning Back Fist**: A difficult spinning punch where the fighter steps across their body, turning their back to the opponent before simultaneously extending their arm and spinning through to face them again.

7. **Superman Punch**: Delivered following a feinted kick. The fighter lifts their leg as if to kick, then throws it back while throwing a straight punch from the same side.

8. **Overhand**: A rear punch that loops high over an opponent's guard before smashing downwards on the head.

### Elbows (Sok)

1. **Crossing Elbow**: Delivered with lateral movement of the pointed elbow with power generated similar to a hook.

2. **Spike Elbow/Downward Elbow**: Moves vertically like a hammer crashing down on top of the opponent's skull.

3. **Uppercut Elbow**: Similar to an uppercut punch but with the elbow point making contact.

4. **Spinning Back Elbow**: Similar to spinning back fist but with the elbow point making contact instead of the fist.

5. **Flying Elbow**: Requires leaping from the canvas and launching toward the opponent with explosive force.

6. **Pull-Elbow/Strip Elbow**: Used when an opponent has a tight guard. The fighter grabs the opponent's forearm and pulls their guard down to create an opening for a slicing elbow.

### Knees (Ti Khao)

1. **Knee**: A stabbing strike with the point of the knee. Can be done from clinch or at range. Power is generated by pushing off the ground with the striking leg and driving forward with the hips.

2. **Roundhouse Knee**: Used when clinching and too close to drive a stabbing knee. The knee is whipped around the side of the body, striking with the inside of the knee rather than the point.

3. **Jumping Knee**: A long-range knee strike delivered by jumping from range and driving the knee forward into the opponent's stomach or head.

4. **Scissor Knee**: A version of the jumping knee that begins with a feint. The fighter launches as if to land their rear knee before "bicycling" their legs mid-air to deliver a strike off the opposing side.

### Kicks (Te)

1. **Roundhouse Kick**: The conventional Muay Thai kick that is perhaps the sport's most common weapon. A fighter uses their shin to kick through their opponents' ribs with power generated via horizontal rotation of the hips and standing foot.

2. **Switch Kick**: A kick fired from the lead leg. To generate power, the fighter "switches" stance, bouncing quickly from orthodox to southpaw (or vice versa).

3. **Head Kick**: A variation of the roundhouse kick targeting the opponent's head and neck.

4. **Low Kick**: Another variation of the roundhouse kick targeting the thighs and quads of an opponent.

5. **Inside Leg Kick**: Thrown fast to the inside of the lead leg when a fighter is placing too much weight on their front foot.

6. **Teep (Push Kick)**: The Muay Thai term for push kick. Weight is shifted onto the standing leg while the striking foot stabs outwards with hip thrust creating power. Usually used like a jab to control range and create openings.

7. **Switch Teep**: A variation on the teep that requires feinting with one leg, "cycling" the hips at the height of the feint, causing a small jump as the alternate leg is thrust forward.

8. **Shuffle Teep/Pendulum Teep**: More aggressive than standard teep. The fighter steps their back leg directly behind their front foot before planting weight onto it, skipping forward to teep a distant or retreating opponent.

9. **Axe Kick**: Requires lifting the extended leg high across the front of the body, then whipping it down so the heel smashes into the opponent's head, jaw, or collarbone.

10. **Spinning Back Kick**: Requires stepping across the body before spinning so the back faces the opponent. Once the foot has landed, the fighter kicks straight out behind with the opposite leg.

11. **Spinning Hook Kick**: Begins like the back kick, but rather than kicking out behind, the fighter continues to rotate, whipping the straightened leg out high so the heel crashes into the side of the opponent's head.

### Footwork and Movement

1. **Feint/Slide**: The act of faking a roundhouse kick by stepping forward and dragging the rear foot behind while lifting the hip and lowering the kicking-side arm slightly.

2. **Drop Step**: Switching stance by stepping the front leg back and rotating the shoulders. Usually done as an opponent moves in to attack.

3. **Shuffle (Saenchai Shuffle)**: The act of faking a switch-kick as popularized by the prodigal fighter Saenchai. Quickly switch stance to draw a reaction before immediately switching back to throw a strike from the dominant stance.

4. **Death March**: When a fighter looking to engage in clinch wears down an opponent by marching forward with high knees, connecting knees to elbows to create a strong block with every step.

5. **Pivot/Quarter Turn**: Like a matador evading a charging bull, used to step out of the path of an aggressive opponent while keeping them in the line of fire for strikes.

### Defense and Counters

1. **Long Guard**: A defensive position where one arm is extended forward to maintain distance and parry incoming strikes.

## Clinch Techniques (Chap Kho)

The clinch is a fundamental aspect of Muay Thai where fighters engage in close-quarters grappling, primarily using upper body control to land knees, elbows, and short strikes.

## Match Structure and Scoring

### Rounds and Timing
- Professional Muay Thai matches typically consist of five rounds
- Each round lasts three minutes
- One-minute rest between rounds

### Scoring System
- Unlike the 10-point must system in boxing or MMA, Muay Thai judges score the fight in its entirety
- While rounds are still recorded with a 6/7/8/9/10 point system, these are meant to help judges paint an overall picture of the fight
- The first round is often scored 10-10 as fighters feel each other out
- The fifth round may see action slow down if both fighters believe they've done enough to win

### Scoring Considerations
1. **Determined Aggression** (lowest importance)
   - Aggression that forces action or pushes the pace against a more tentative fighter

2. **Ring & Action Control** (moderate importance)
   - Ability to control action and exchanges in the ring
   - Effective defense and offense while moving forward, backward, laterally, or against the ropes

3. **Effective Technical Execution** (highest importance)
   - Clean strikes that land with power and precision
   - Kicks and knee strikes are valued more highly than punches
   - Visible reaction from opponent (staggering, wincing, etc.)
   - Damage inflicted

### Unique Aspects of Muay Thai Scoring
- A fighter can lose early rounds narrowly and still win the fight by dominating later rounds
- Kicks and knee strikes are valued more highly than punches
- The fighter who appears fresher and less damaged at the end often gets the decision
- Showing dominance in the clinch is highly valued

## Damage Assessment
- Visible reactions from strikes (staggering, wincing)
- Cuts and bruising
- Knockdowns
- Fighter's ability to continue attacking and defending effectively
- Overall appearance and composure at the end of the fight
